This thesis investigates the drivers and mitigation of greenhouse‑gas (GHG) emissions across the Eurozone‑19 from 2008 to 2020, using panel‑data regression methods to quantify how key energy and economic factors influence national emission levels. Chapter 1 reviews the evidence of anthropogenic warming, examines EU climate targets  and describes the evolution of the EU Emissions Trading System and its role in reducing industrial and transport‐sector CO₂ emissions.
Chapter 2 introduces the econometric framework and data sources drawn from Eurostat, defining the dependent variable (log of cumulative GHG emissions) and six explanatory covariates: primary energy consumption, fossil‐fuel share, energy intensity, manufacturing value‑added, renewable‑energy share, and median household income.
Chapter 3 applies fixed-effects and random-effects models, selected via the Hausman test, to estimate causal impacts. The results indicate that primary energy consumption has the largest positive effect on emissions, while higher carbon intensity in manufacturing and dependence on fossil fuels increase emissions. Large economies (Germany, Spain, France and Italy) are still the biggest emitters. Policy recommendations highlight more ambitious EU‑wide targets for 2030, expansion of CCS investments, and enhanced support for developing‐country transitions, reinforcing the urgency of collective action to meet Paris‐Agreement goals.
